### Hi there, internet stranger 👋

I'm Evgeny, and I code... Sometimes. I learned and taught beginner to advanced `Java` at Uni, use quite a lot of `R` for data-related projects, and have been messing around with `React` as of recently.

- ⌨️ [type.evgenyastapov.com](https://type.evgenyastapov.com), a typing test site I'm making for fun.
- 🌎 [evg.to](https://evg.to), my own URL shortener running on Node.js, Express and GCP App Engine.
