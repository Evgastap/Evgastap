### Hi there, internet stranger 👋

I'm Evgeny, and I write code... Sometimes. I am the CTO at [Superconnectors](https://superconnectors.io), am the chief everything guy at, ehm, my [own business](https://evgenyastapov.com), like to [film stupid videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eabxU9ozfZw), and am fueled by helping out everyone who's doing cool shit.

## Currently working on:
- 👀 `Stealth` - A/B testing tool with a twist

## Recent projects:
- 💹 [10kreader.com](https://www.10kreader.com/), a site to retrieve, read and interact with filings of any public U.S. companies. Courtesy of [@KevinGBojan](https://github.com/KevinGBojan).
- 🔭 [evgenyastapov.com](https://evgenyastapov.com), my personal portfolio.
