### Hi there, internet stranger 👋

I'm Evgeny, and I write code... Sometimes. I work at [TNW](https://thenextweb.com), am the chief everything guy at, ehm, my [own business](https://evgenyastapov.com), like to [film stupid videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eabxU9ozfZw), and am fueled by helping out everyone who's doing cool shit.

## Currently working on:
- 👀 `Stealth` - the first side project of mine that will see the light of day, a way to edit long-form videos into shorter ones.

## Recent projects:
- 💹 [10kreader.com](https://www.10kreader.com/), a site to retrieve, read and interact with filings of any public U.S. companies. Courtesy of [@KevinGBojan](https://github.com/KevinGBojan).
- 🔭 [evgenyastapov.com](https://evgenyastapov.com), my personal portfolio.
- ⌨️ [type.evgenyastapov.com](https://type.evgenyastapov.com), an aesthetic typing speed test website that I made for fun.
- 🌎 [evg.to](https://evg.to), my own URL shortener running on Node.js, Express and GCP App Engine.
