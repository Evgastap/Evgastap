### Hi there, internet stranger 👋

I'm Evgeny, and I code... Sometimes. I learned and taught beginner to advanced `Java` at Uni, use quite a lot of `R` for data-related projects, and have been messing around with `React` as of recently.

## Currently working on:
- 🌱 Learning Next.js.
- 📊 Getting better at SQL.

## Recent projects:
- 🔭 [evgenyastapov.com](https://evgenyastapov.com), my personal portfolio.
- ⌨️ [type.evgenyastapov.com](https://type.evgenyastapov.com), an aesthetic typing speed test website that I made for fun.
- 🌎 [evg.to](https://evg.to), my own URL shortener running on Node.js, Express and GCP App Engine.

## About me:
